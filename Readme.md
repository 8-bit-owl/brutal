A bold, unapologetic, and honest operating system written in modern C
</p>

## About

Striking modernist shapes and bold use of modern C are the hallmarks of **BRUTAL**.<br>
**BRUTAL** combine the desire of UNIX utopia from the 1970s with modern technology and engineering.

## Roadmap

Right now the main goal of brutal is to run doom.

See the [roadmap](meta/Roadmap.md) file for more information on how we plan to get there.

## Modern C

Brutal is written in a dialect of C called modern C characterize by the following principle:

- Avoid pointers and prefer passing by value.
- The standard library is old and unsafe, **don't use it**.
- Don't be afraid of writing type generic code.

Here is more resources on the subject:

Striking modernist shapes and bold use of modern C are the hallmarks of <b>BRUTAL</b>.<br>
<b>BRUTAL</b> combine the desire of UNIX utopia from the 1970s with modern technology and engineering.

## About

**BRUTAL** is a micro-kernel base operating system targeting the x86_64 architecture. ARM and Risc-V support is planned.

## Roadmap

Right now the main goal of brutal is to run doom.

See the [roadmap](doc/roadmap.md) file for more information on how we plan to get there and where you can contribute.

## Modern C

Brutal is written in a dialect of C called modern C characterize by the following principle:

- Avoid pointers and prefer value semantic.
- The standard library is old and unsafe, **don't use it**.
- Don't be afraid of writing type generic code.
